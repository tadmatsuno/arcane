- Test linefitting including lineshift
- Allow batch analysis
- Read a single linelist probably from VALD, and a configuration file where each line presents the species to fit, the wavelength window for absorption lines and for continuum estimation, and possibility to remove and add lines 
- Also need criterion about whether the detection is robust, provide upper limits. A comparison to X/H=-9.99 spectra would be useful
- Add a parallel calculation for MOOG. Create and work in a temporary directry
- Add a function that adopts a correction (non-LTE or 3D) based on a precomputed grid

- Maybe allow alpha_fe, s_fe, r_fe inputs?
- add More tests for spectral synthesis and fitting
- Add a turbospectrum, pySME support as well as their non-LTE functionalities
