- Maybe allow alpha_fe, s_fe, r_fe inputs?
- Add a turbospectrum support
- Allow MOOG to take VALD linelist class as an input
- Allow batch analysis
  - Read a single linelist probably from VALD, and a configuration file where each line presents the species to fit, the wavelength window for absorption lines and for continuum estimation, and possibility to remove and add lines 
- Add a parallel calculation for MOOG. Create and work in a temporary directry
