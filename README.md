Analyzing high-Resolution spectra for Chemical AbundaNcE

Tools that have been used by T. Matsuno for abundance analysis using high-resolution stellar spectra

Currently supported features are 
  - Continuum placement (continuum)
  - Equivalent widths measurements (ew)
  - Reading, writing, and interpolating model atmospheres (mdlatm) currently only for MARCS
  - More will be added...
